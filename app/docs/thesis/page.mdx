# The Agent Factory Thesis

In the AI era, the most valuable companies won't sell software — they will manufacture **AI employees**: role-based systems that compose tools, spawn specialist agents, and deliver outcomes at scale.

The SaaS era sold subscriptions.  
The **Agent Factory era sells results**.

Buyers define intent.  
Agents execute.  
Humans supervise and verify.

This model industrializes execution through:
- Machine-readable specifications  
- Reusable skills  
- **Standard Tool Protocols (MCP)** — a shared tool-connection standard  
- Cloud-native infrastructure  

The focus shifts from **manual workflows** to **capability on demand**.

What remains constant:

- **Intent**
- **Verification**
- **Outcome**

## The Paradigm Shift

**SaaS Era (Tools)**
- Product: Software tools
- Value metric: Per-seat subscriptions
- Execution: Manual and visible
- Human role: Operator

**Agent Factory Era (Labor)**
- Product: AI employees
- Value metric: Per-outcome results
- Execution: Automated and industrialized
- Human role: Supervisor and verifier


## The Industrialized Stack

### Intent
The high-level blueprint — goals, constraints, budgets, and permissions.

### The Factory
A self-correcting engine where machine-readable specs act as DNA for agents, connecting reusable skills through MCP tool contracts.

### Outcome
High-fidelity actions and artifacts — delivered on demand, verified for accuracy, and continuously improved through feedback loops.

---

Winners in this era will not be measured by seats sold,  
but by **outcomes guaranteed** — and the problems they solve.
