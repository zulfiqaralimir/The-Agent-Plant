# The Agent Factory Thesis

In the AI era, the most valuable companies won't sell software — they will manufacture **AI employees**: role-based systems that compose tools, spawn specialist agents, and deliver outcomes at scale.

The SaaS era sold subscriptions.  
The **Agent Factory era sells results**.

Buyers define intent.  
Agents execute.  
Humans supervise and verify.

This model industrializes execution through:
- Machine-readable specifications  
- Reusable skills  
- **Standard Tool Protocols (MCP)** — a shared tool-connection standard  
- Cloud-native infrastructure  

The focus shifts from **manual workflows** to **capability on demand**.

What remains constant:

- **Intent**
- **Verification**
- **Outcome**

## The Paradigm Shift

| Feature | The SaaS Era (Tools) | The Agent Factory Era (Labor) |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Product | Software Tools | AI Employees |
| Value Metric | Per-seat subscriptions | Per-outcome results |
| Execution Model | Manual & visible | Automated & industrialized |
| Human Role | Operator | Supervisor & verifier |
| Integration | Rigid APIs | Standard Tool Protocols (MCP) |
| Focus | How the work is done | That the work is done — verifiably |

## The Industrialized Stack

### Intent
The high-level blueprint — goals, constraints, budgets, and permissions.

### The Factory
A self-correcting engine where machine-readable specs act as DNA for agents, connecting reusable skills through MCP tool contracts.

### Outcome
High-fidelity actions and artifacts — delivered on demand, verified for accuracy, and continuously improved through feedback loops.

Winners in this era will not be measured by seats sold,  
but by **outcomes guaranteed** — and the problems they solve.
